Wilderness Explorers - HTML Project
This is a simple, single-page website for a fictional adventure travel company called "Wilderness Explorers." The entire page is built using only HTML, demonstrating fundamental web structure and content organization. It serves as a great starting point for a beginner's web development project.

âœ¨ Features
The website is organized into several distinct sections using semantic HTML tags:

Header: A main title <h1> and a tagline <p>.

Navigation: A simple navigation bar with links to "Home," an external travel site, and the National Park Service.

Our Philosophy: An introduction to the company's mission, using various text formatting tags like <strong>, <em>, <ins>, and <del>.

Featured Expeditions: A showcase section with images of Indian national parks and wildlife to visually engage the user.

Explorer's Handbook: A helpful guide for aspiring adventurers, which includes:

An ordered list (<ol>) of the "Top 5 National Parks to Visit."

An unordered list (<ul>) of "Essentials to carry."

A description list (<dl>) defining common "Outdoor Terminology."

Expedition Packages: A <table> that clearly outlines the destination, price, and duration of available tour packages.

Footer: A contact section with email and phone information.
